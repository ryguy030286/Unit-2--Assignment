I didn't have a partner for this assignment.

The 3 different bootstrap components are.....

1) A modal button in the hero on the index page.
2) A drop down in the form on the left side of the trial page.
3) A carousel of 5 images on the schedule page.

For the form alignment I created another grid inside the pages grid.
